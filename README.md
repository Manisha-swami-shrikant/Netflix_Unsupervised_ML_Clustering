Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To perform the clustering analysis, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset:

Ensure you have your dataset (e.g., netflix_data.csv) in the data directory. The dataset should contain relevant features for clustering.
